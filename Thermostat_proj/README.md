Build a thermostat that monitors the room temperature and controls heating/air conditioning devices based on the desired temperature set on the thermostat.
It will have a connection to a remote device and exchange temperature information with that device.
Involves using a temperature sensor, LCD display, control knob (rotary encoder), two buttons, red and green LEDs (if heat or cool is on), and a serial interface (RS-232).
